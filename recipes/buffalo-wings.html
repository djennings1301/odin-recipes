    <h1>Buffalo Wings</h1>
    <img src="../images/wings.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most popular bar snacks in the U.S. was actually born in a small Buffalo, NY, bar in 1964. Without the Anchor Bar and the ingenuity of its owner (she wanted to re-purpose leftover cooked wings to feed her family), many a game day, bar-hopping American would likely never know you could combine crispy wings bathed in sweet-hot sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black peppper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hot sauce (such as Frank's)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>Ranch dressing, for serving</li>
        <li>Carrot sticks, for serving</li>
        <li>Celery sticks, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. Toss wings with oil and seaon with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Tansfer to baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden and skin is crispy.  Around 50-60 minutes, flipping halfway through</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together hot sauce and honey. Bring to simmer then stir in butter. Cook until butter is melted and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Heat broiler on low. Transfer baked wings to a bowl and toss with buffalo sauce until completely coated. Return wings to rack and broil—watching carefully!—until sauce caramelizes, 3 minutes. Serve with ranch dressing and vegetables.</li>
    </ol>
